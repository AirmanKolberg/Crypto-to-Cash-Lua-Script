# Crypto to Cash

A simple Lua script I wrote (with the help of some Python) to calculate the amount of any cryptocurrency (currently set to ADA, but can be configured for any coin) required to sell to convert to X amount of dollars (2700 is default, though this can of course be configured).  This is a quick script I made just to play around with Lua, so enjoy!
