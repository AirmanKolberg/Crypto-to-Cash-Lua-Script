# Crypto to Cash

A simple Lua script I wrote (with the help of some Python) to calculate the amount of any cryptocurrency (currently set to ADA, but can be configured for any coin) required to sell to convert to X amount of dollars (the default is waiting for 750 ADA to be valued at $2,700, though this can of course be configured).  This is a quick script I made just to play around with Lua, so enjoy!
